#### Issue Labels

This folder contains a json file that manages the issue labels for the CyclopsMC organization.

It is applied to our repos via [org-labels](https://github.com/repo-utils/org-labels).

```bash
$ org-labels standardize CyclopsMC settings
```

If you wish to use this for your own repos, use:

```bash
$ org-labels standardize username{/optional repo} CyclopsMC/settings
```
